# Summary

The Library and Information Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Library and Information Studies** using online materials.

The field of LIS encompasses the organization, access, preservation, and ethical management of information in diverse formats and contexts, blending theory from information science with practical applications in libraries, archives, and digital environments.

The program is divided into phases with logical progression: prerequisites build foundational skills, core subjects provide essential knowledge, advanced electives allow specialization, and a capstone synthesizes learning.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
