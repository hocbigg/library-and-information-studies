# Summary

The Library and Information Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Library and Information Studies** using online materials.

The field of LIS encompasses the organization, access, preservation, and ethical management of information in diverse formats and contexts, blending theory from information science with practical applications in libraries, archives, and digital environments.

The program is divided into phases with logical progression: prerequisites build foundational skills, core subjects provide essential knowledge, advanced electives allow specialization, and a capstone synthesizes learning.

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

# Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential foundation of the discipline. Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **Foundations of Library and Information Studies**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic ideas, history, and professional identity of the field.

2. **Information, Users, and Society**  
   Next, learn how people actually interact with information in real life and the societal issues connected to it.

3. **Knowledge Organization and Discovery**  
   Then move to the methods and systems used to describe, organize, and find information – a central skill in LIS.

4. **Library Services and Collections**  
   Finally, understand the practical, public-facing work of libraries: helping users and building collections.
