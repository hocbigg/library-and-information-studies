# Summary

The Library and Information Studies curriculum is a **complete education in Library and Information Studies** using online materials.

The field of LIS encompasses the organization, access, preservation, and ethical management of information in diverse formats and contexts, blending theory from information science with practical applications in libraries, archives, and digital environments.

The program is divided into phases with logical progression: prerequisites build foundational skills, core subjects provide essential knowledge, advanced electives allow specialization, and a capstone synthesizes learning.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

# Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

The curriculum is divided into **Core sections** (essential for everyone) and **Specialization Tracks** (deeper or more focused paths you can choose later).

### Core Sections

These four sections form the essential foundation of the discipline. Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **Foundations of Library and Information Studies**  
   Start here. This section introduces the basic ideas, history, and professional identity of the field.

2. **Information, Users, and Society**  
   Next, learn how people actually interact with information in real life and the societal issues connected to it.

3. **Knowledge Organization and Discovery**  
   Then move to the methods and systems used to describe, organize, and find information – a central skill in LIS.

4. **Library Services and Collections**  
   Finally, understand the practical, public-facing work of libraries: helping users and building collections.

### Specialization Tracks

After completing the Core, you can pick one or more of the remaining sections depending on the direction you want to explore:

- **Management, Research, and Professional Practice**: Choose this if you are interested in leading libraries, managing teams, doing research, or understanding the business and policy side of information organizations.
- **Digital, Data, and Technical LIS**: Choose this if you want to work with technology, digital collections, databases, user experience design, or research data.
- **Archives, Records, and Preservation**: Choose this if you are drawn to historical materials, recordkeeping, archives, or long-term preservation of physical and digital items.
- **Specialized and Community Services**: Choose this if you want to focus on serving specific groups (children, youth, diverse communities) or on topics like open access and scholarly communication.
